## initial setup

### backend

- I have installed the usual express and nodemon to get the server running on port 3000.
- set up the data type that is required in the app using json and form data.
- set up mnongoose.js using cloud mongo.db
- created endpoints in the routes folder
- use some mongoose schemas to create and delete data
- using jwt for some authentication created a auth toke and a refesh token
- the auth token is normally used to check if the user has i nfact logged in and has access to the endpoints

### frontend

- set up a stack using webpack
